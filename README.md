This feature allows automatic enrollment immediately after randomization with the [REDCap randomization module](https://apps.icts.uiowa.edu/confluence/display/REDCapDocs/REDCap+Randomization+Module).

This feature also defaults subject_id in the affiliated with the given format.
<DAG_ID> + "-" + <FIRST_LETTER_IN_FIRST_NAME> + <FIRST_LETTER_IN_LAST_NAME> + <RECORD_ID_WITH_0_PADDED_DIGITS>

  1. Value: `1` / Destination arm: `arm_2` - if value is randomly set as `1`, the subject will be enrolled into `arm_2`
  2. Value: `2` / Destination arm: `arm_3` - if value is randomly set as `2`, the subject will be enrolled into `arm_3`
* **PAD digits length**: `3` - will be used to build subject ID value
* **First name field**: `first_name` - will be used to build subject ID value
